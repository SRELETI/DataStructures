# Overview
*Implementation of all important functions of LinkedList*

  1. Adding a node to the List (Begining, End, After a node)
  2. Deleting a node
  3. Print the list
  4. Length of the list(Iterative & Recursive)
  5. Get middle node, get Nth node, get nth from end
  6. Reverse a list (Iterative & Recursive)
  7. Print List in reverse manner
  8. Check if a list is Palindrome
  9. Check if two lists are same
  10. Sorted Insert
  11. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List
  12. Remove Duplicates from unSorted List
  13. Intersection point of two linked lists
  14. Pairwise Swap of elements in a linked list (iterative & recursive)
  15. move last element to first
  16. Intersection of two sorted lists
  17. Delete Alternate nodes
  18. Alternate split of list into two sub lists
  19. Merge Two lists into one
  20. merge sort
  21. Reverse list in groups of size k 
  22. Reverse list in alternate groups of size k
  23. Reverse list from position m to position n
  24. Delete Nodes which have greater value on the right sie
  25. Segregate Even and Odd Nodes in the list
  26. Detect and Remove Loop in the lists
  27. Add Two numbers represented by two Lists
  28. Rotate Lists by k
  29. Flatten a multi level List
  30. Sort list with 0's,1's,2's
  31. pairwise swap of elements in list by changing links
  32. Remove middle points in a linked list of line segments
  33. maximum sum out of two sorted lists having some common nodes.
  
*Implementation of Queue*

  1. Queue Implementation based on Array(Circular Array)
  2. Queue Implementation based on LinkedList
  3. Deque Implementation based on Array
  4. Deque Implementation based on LinkedList
  5. Priority Queue Implementation based on Array
